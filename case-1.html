          <h4>
            Australia's distinctive location on the planet has resulted in a
            rich diversity of plant species. Unfortunately, many of these
            species are currently endangered. The traditional information
            sources about these plants can be overwhelming, as they often rely
            on lengthy texts. Therefore, the project aims to increase awareness
            about these plants through a visual-centered learning experience.

            <h4>
              Corresponding with the initial concept, the project's main feature
              that differentiates it from existing websites is presenting the
              plant's life cycle. However, the team could not find suitable
              images that made the website fully functioning as the original
              idea. Since the website focuses on endangered Australian plants,
              online resources only contain a few snippets of these distinctive
              species. However, the team opted to keep the key feature and
              instead created illustrations to represent each plant.

            <h3>Missing data</h3>
            <h4>
              Upon the implementation, our team encountered challenges with the
              chosen datasets. Specifically, some data were found to be
              incomplete and limited in terms of information. As a result, our
              team concluded that these datasets were unlikely to yield
              considerable benefits to users.
            </h4>

            <h4>
              Our team first reexamined the three datasets to address the issue
              at hand. The team carefully selected only the pertinent data to
              include and build up the botanical features. Furthermore, we
              crafted a more elaborate and comprehensive introduction, which was
              not included in the chosen datasets. Our aim was to create a
              concise profile for every plant accompanied by the original
              datasets.
            </h4>
          </div>

          <h3>Insufficient Interaction with Data</h3>
          <h4>
            Upon finishing the initial phase of the final project, which
            involved creating a minimum viable product, our team realized that
            certain features had been eliminated, leading to a subpar level of
            engagement. In order to tackle this issue, we decided to gather
            suggestions from our target audiences. Through conducting brief
            interviews with potential users, we were able to integrate the
            concept of flashcards, thereby enhancing the overall interactive
            learning experience.

            which reinforces the user-friendly nature of the website. During the
            follow-up interview, participants suggested the refined function,
            the drag-and-drop section, can assist their learning process, which
            aligns with the project's goal of enhancing the user's learning

          <h4>
            At the beginning of the project, my expectation was to have the
            opportunity to learn along the team collaboration experience,
            building upon my knowledge of product creation from the aspects of
            research, design, and coding; and lastly, form into a website that I
            could proudly present. In the end, I noticed that my learning
            experience did practice my skills from these three aspects.
          </h4>

          <h4>
            Although I felt a sense of reward after the three months, I noticed
            that our team communication could have improved. Even though the
            team constantly communicated throughout the project to fill the gap,
            not all members were in the loop, which resulted in an increase in
            workload. However, from a positive perspective, the issue provided
            the team with another opportunity to practice communication skills
            and crisis management; I believe that I can develop these skills
            further and apply them in the future.
